# ComfyUI- CCSR upscaler node

This is a simple wrapper node for https://github.com/csslc/CCSR

NOT a proper ComfyUI implementation, so not very efficient and there might be memory issues, tested on 4090 and 4x upscale tiled worked well.

The model (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jM1mxDryPk9CTuFTvYcraP2XIVzbPiw_?usp=drive_link) goes to ComfyUI/models/checkpoints
