# ComfyUI- CCSR upscaler node
## Update:

Models now available here in safetensors format here, by default fp16 is used:

There's also a new node that autodownloads them, in which case they go to `ComfyUI/models/CCSR`

The old node simply selects from checkpoints -folder, for backwards compatibility I won't change that.

This is a simple wrapper node for https://github.com/csslc/CCSR

As such, it's NOT a proper native ComfyUI implementation, so not very efficient and there might be memory issues, tested on 4090 and 4x upscale tiled worked well.



Original model:
The model (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jM1mxDryPk9CTuFTvYcraP2XIVzbPiw_?usp=drive_link) goes to ComfyUI/models/checkpoints

I suggest installing with the comfyui-manager:
